We are happy and honoured to announce that our professor and researcher Prof. Enes Pasalic, PhD received the Zois Award for outstanding scientific achievements in the field of cryptography. Zois Awards and Recognitions are the most prestigious awards for exceptional achievements in scientific research and development activities, awarded to researchers in the Republic of Slovenia.

Prof. Enes Pasalic, PhD, has been recognized as one of the world's leading researchers in the area of design and analysis of symmetric ciphers and cryptographically interesting discrete combinatorial structures, especially the Boolean functions. He was part of the research team that developed the new S-box used in the 3G mobile network protocol and in the stream cipher SNOW for use in the 3GPP standard. Between 2012 and 2018, he published 41 scientific articles in high quality journals such as IEEE and Finite Fields and their Applications. Since 2018, he is also leading  the UP FAMNIT Center for Cryptography at the University of Primorska.

Recall that last year UP FAMNIT and UP IAM recieved a research program  entitled "Mathematical Modelling and Encryption: From Theoretical Concepts to Everyday Applications", led by Prof. Enes Pasalic, PhD. Until 2025 they will develop innovative opportunities for thorough research in the field of mathematics. Concrete results will ensure secure communication with blockchain technology in modelling to generate preliminary results in different domains. The emphasis will be on the themes regarding sustainable built environments.

Last year, Prof. Enes Pasalic,PhD was awarded as a professor and researcher at UP FAMNIT and UP IAM, with the 2017 Scientific Excellence Award in Natural Sciences and Engineering.

We congratulate Prof. Enes Pasalic, PhD for this excellent achievement and important award!
