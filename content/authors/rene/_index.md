René is a PhD student at UP Famnit working under the supervision of prof. Enes Pasalic. He is currently in his third year. His main research interests are linear codes and Boolean functions. He is interested in their properties and their interactions with different mathematical objects. He has also a special interest in cryptanalytic techniques applied to block ciphers such as non-linear distinguishers.
